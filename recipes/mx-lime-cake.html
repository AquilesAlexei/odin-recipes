        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This Mexican Lime Icebox Cake, known as a carlota in Spanish, is
            a cool, creamy no-bake treat that layers a cream filling with 
            crisp Maria Cookies. Here, we whisk together cream cheese, 
            condensed and evaporated milk with lime juice and zest to make 
            a refreshing citrus filling that’s set between the cookies. 
            Once assembled, we simply chill the cake in the refrigerator 
            overnight until the cookies absorb the flavors of the filling 
            and soften into a sliceable, cake-like consistency.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 oz. reduced-fat cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
            <li>1 can (14 oz.) of sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li>1 can (12 oz.) of evaporated milk</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of lime juice</li>
            <li>2 tsp. of lime zest (about 4 limes), plus more zest for 
                garnish</li>
            <li>2 pkg. (7 oz.) of Maria cookies</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, stir together cream cheese and 2 tsp. lime 
                zest until blended. Using whisk, gradually whisk in 
                condensed milk until blended. Whisk in evaporated milk and 
                lime juice until smooth and thick. Using spoon, spread ½ cup 
                cream cheese mixture on bottom of 8” glass baking dish.</li>

            <li>Top cream cheese mixture with 9 Maria cookies, arranging in 
                single layer. Gently spread cookies with about ¾ cup cream 
                cheese mixture. Repeat layering 3 times more, using ¾ cup 
                cream cheese mixture and 9 cookies per layer, ending with 
                remaining cream cheese mixture. Cover cake with plastic wrap; 
                transfer to refrigerator. Chill at least 8 hours, or overnight. 
                Garnish cake with lime zest, if desired, before serving.</li>
        </ol>
