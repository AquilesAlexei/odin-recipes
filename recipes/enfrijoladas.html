    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Enfrijoladas are made of corn tortillas dipped in a flavorful bean 
        sauce. Stuff them with cheese, and you have an easy and delicious 
        Mexican vegetarian meal.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups black beans</li>
        <li>3 chipotles in adobo</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup stock</li>
        <li>8 corn tortillas</li>
        <li>3-4 tablespoons finely chopped onion</li>
        <li>Monterrey Jack cheese</li>
        <li>1 avocado (optional)</li>
        <li>Cilantro (optional)</li>
        <li>Crema (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the beans, garlic, chipotles and salt to a blender and 
            puree until smooth.  Add stock (or water) until the puree has 
            the consistency of a thick soup.  Taste for seasoning and heat 
            level. </li>

        <li>Warm the corn tortillas in the oven or microwave.  Place a big 
            dollop of bean puree on a plate.  Dredge one side of a tortilla 
            in the bean puree.  Flip the tortilla and fill with onion and 
            cheese.  Roll tight and place in a baking dish seam side down 
            (add some puree to the baking dish to prevent sticking).</li>

        <li>Continue rolling all of the tortillas -- this batch was enough 
            for 8 rolled tortillas.</li>

        <li>Cover the tortillas in the baking dish with the remaining bean 
            puree.  Bake at 425F for 8-10 minutes or until the cheese has 
            melted.</li>

        <li>Serve immediately and top with your choice of avocado, cheese, 
            cilantro and Crema.</li>
    </ol>
